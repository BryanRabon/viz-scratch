# viz-scratch
Repository for one-off plots, ideas, and gifs - anything smaller or more transient than a regular visualization

Place each new plot/idea/gif in its own subdirectory. Use a descriptive folder name to help us find it again later.
* Use relative paths that assume the working directory == the subdirectory. (This will help with later renaming if needed.)
* If you create a remake.yaml, place it within the subdirectory.
* If you want to reuse code from other scratch subdirectories, place a copy of the code in your current subdirectory.
